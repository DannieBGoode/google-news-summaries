# Google News Summaries (Chrome + Firefox MV3 Extension)

Adds a small summarize button next to each article on https://news.google.com/* that generates a single-line summary using an AI model (initially OpenAI, model configurable e.g., `gpt-5-nano`). Includes an Options page to configure provider, model, API key, and deep-fetch behavior.

## Features

- Works on any Google News page (https://news.google.com/*)
- Injects a small üß† button next to each article title
- On click, generates a concise one-line summary
- Options page lets you set:
  - Provider (OpenAI for initial release)
  - Model (e.g., gpt-5-nano)
  - API Key
  - Deep fetch (fetch original article for better summaries)
- Handles dynamically loaded cards as you scroll

## Install (Chrome)

1. Open `chrome://extensions`
2. Enable Developer Mode (top right)
3. Click ‚ÄúLoad unpacked‚Äù
4. Select this project folder
5. Click ‚ÄúDetails‚Äù ‚Üí ‚ÄúExtension options‚Äù (or open the Options page from the extension‚Äôs action)
6. Set:
   - Provider: OpenAI
   - Model: gpt-5-nano (or your preferred model name)
   - API Key: your OpenAI key
   - Deep fetch: enable or disable as desired
7. Visit https://news.google.com/ and click the üß† next to an article title.

## Install (Firefox)

1. Open `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox`
2. Click ‚ÄúLoad Temporary Add-on‚Ä¶‚Äù
3. Select `manifest.json` in this project folder
4. Open the extension‚Äôs Options page (via Add-ons Manager)
5. Configure Provider/Model/API Key/Deep fetch
6. Visit https://news.google.com/ and click the üß† button

Note: Firefox support uses MV3 and the `browser_specific_settings` in `manifest.json`. Temporary add-ons reset when Firefox restarts.

## How it works

- Content script (`src/contentScript.js`) finds title links that look like Google News articles (e.g., `./read/...`) and injects a small button and bubble UI.
- On click:
  - If Deep Fetch is enabled and an article URL is available, the background service worker fetches the article HTML, converts it to text, and summarizes it.
  - Otherwise it summarizes the visible card text (title + snippet).
- Background service worker (`src/background.js`) manages settings and calls the AI provider (OpenAI).
- Options page (`options/`) stores settings in `chrome.storage.sync`.

## Files

- `manifest.json` ‚Äî MV3 manifest, content script on news.google.com, background service worker, options page
- `src/contentScript.js` ‚Äî inject UI, extract card content, talk to background
- `src/styles.css` ‚Äî bubble/button styling
- `src/background.js` ‚Äî settings, cross-origin fetch for article HTML, OpenAI call
- `options/options.html` ‚Äî options UI
- `options/options.css` ‚Äî options styles
- `options/options.js` ‚Äî options logic
- `README.md` ‚Äî this file

## Permissions

- `storage` ‚Äî store provider, model, API key, deepFetch flag
- `scripting` ‚Äî standard MV3 permission required in some cases for script operations
- `host_permissions`:
  - `https://news.google.com/*` ‚Äî run on Google News
  - `https://api.openai.com/*` ‚Äî call OpenAI API
  - `http://*/*` and `https://*/*` ‚Äî allow deep fetching article content across the web (can be toggled off by disabling Deep Fetch in Options)

You can narrow host permissions later if you prefer; deep fetching requires cross-origin access from the background.

## Privacy

- The extension never summarizes automatically; it only sends content when you click the üß† button.
- When Deep Fetch is off, it summarizes only the visible card text (title + snippet).
- When Deep Fetch is on, it fetches the original article HTML from the background to improve summary quality.
- Your API key is stored in browser sync storage.

## Troubleshooting

- ‚ÄúOpenAI API key not set‚Äù: Open the Options page and set your key.
- ‚ÄúSummarization failed‚Äù: Check model name and key validity, and ensure network access to OpenAI is not blocked by a firewall/VPN.
- No üß† button appears:
  - Ensure the extension is loaded and enabled.
  - Confirm the page is under `https://news.google.com/`.
  - Reload the page; Google News is highly dynamic and may change DOM structure. The content script uses heuristics on `./read/` links and common containers.
- Firefox: If the extension disappears after restart, reload as a Temporary Add-on.

## Notes and Future Enhancements

- Current deep fetch uses a lightweight HTML-to-text conversion. For best quality, integrate Mozilla Readability to extract main article content robustly.
- Provider abstraction supports adding more providers (OpenRouter, Azure OpenAI, Claude) in the background worker.
- Potential additions: caching summaries, toolbar action to summarize all visible cards, keyboard shortcut support.

## Development

- Changes to service worker require reloading the extension.
- Use DevTools on the extension‚Äôs background page to inspect logs if needed.
- DOM selectors target Google News `./read/` anchors and nearby card containers; minor tweaks may be needed if Google updates their markup.
